Java Project Euler Solutions

by Lincoln Edsall



Personal rules:
• All solutions can run in Eclipse on my laptop in less than 60 seconds on average.
• All solutions are timed the same way, from line one of the solution until the line previous to the output lines. 
• All solutions are formatted the same. Each solution outputs:
    A. The solution
    B. The time in miliseconds taken to run
• Each solution is posted to this Repo once completed with the above formatted output and:
    A. The final working solution to the problem, duh, with no extra code
    B. A header comment with: 
        • The problem
        • The answer
        • Average time to run (average of 5 runs) in miliseconds
        • Short explanation of solution
• All solutions necessitating a text file of given data to run are accompanied by such. 
• Some solutions are accompanied by an extra file(s) that document versions of the solution through time.
  For example: Problem 15 is accompanied by a file containing other solutions to the problem as I was attempting to solve it that are not efficient enough
  but that I wanted to document.
• For some solutions, custom classes with user defined data types were created to assist the solution. 
  These files are compiled into a folder and each used for a solution also accompany that solution.
• Solutions are not plagiarized, and looking up code for algorithms should be resisted. At least until the optimization stage of a solution.
• If the solution to a problem requires some algorithm at the core of the solution, native or pre-made algortithms/methods/libraries should be resisted.
  This is somewhat arbitrary. 
  For example: Problem 13 wants the sum of 50 100-digit numbers, and large numbers being the crux of the problem I resisted using BigInteger in my solution.
• If the solution to a problem can utilize some mathematical formula at the core of the solution, the formula should be resisted.
  For example: Problem 15 wants the lattice paths through a 20x20 grid. I resisted using the mathematical formula for the solution.
